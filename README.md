#Quiz webpage
This project is to modify the website with a form having content with mltiple choice question. The users are needed to mark the corret answer and thereby receiving the score in a modal window. 
In this project, I have modified the interface usinh HTML and CSS, and also maintained the correct folder struture.

The content in the file ('index_with_capital_tags.html') provided was not in an aligned manner and the tags were in block letters. 
Inorder to convert all the HTML element tags to lowercase, I have used python code to convert all the tags and then creating a new file named 'index.html'.

The webpage screenshot is also uploaded in the repository.
